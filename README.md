# FreeCodeCamp assets repo

This repo was created to store static assets used in the FreeCodeCamp challenges along with the code used in the first backend exercises.

### Current projects

  - Local Weather Challenge (assets)
  - TwitchTV (assets)
  - Wikipedia Search (assets)
  - Javascript calculator (full)

Feel free to use, any questions let me know.

For the next Node.JS exercises i will create dedicated repo's.
